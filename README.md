# EventMangementPHP

This was a project for my ISTE 341 Server Programming class at Rochester Institute 
of Technology. The goal of the assignment was to create an all encompasing event 
management system. I really enjoyed this project because it was my first big project 
with php integrating a database and using PDO. It was super fun to create a realistic,
working website.

I definitely struggled with remember each small detail to include on the edit/create
pages and was all over the place, only working on this project for an hour or two 
a day. If I were to do something different next time, I would start out with written
psuodocode of all the actions i want each file to cover and then start the coding so that
I have a plan of action that I can pick up and leave off.
